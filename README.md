> Build software with AI agents — from idea to pull request.

Solune is an agent-driven development platform that turns a feature description into working code. Design customizable Agent Pipelines through a visual GUI, assign AI agents to execute tasks in series or parallel, and track everything on your GitHub Project board — from first commit to Copilot-reviewed pull request.

## Why Solune?

Managing software projects still means juggling disconnected tools: a project board here, an AI assistant there, manual branch management everywhere. When you want AI to do real work — not just answer questions — you end up copy-pasting between chat windows, writing glue scripts, and babysitting every step.

Solune brings it all together. You describe what you want to build, design a pipeline of AI agents in a drag-and-drop interface, and launch. Each agent creates its own sub-issue, branches from the main PR, executes its task, and merges back automatically. The entire flow is tracked on your GitHub Project board with real-time status updates.

What makes Solune different is the pipeline engine. Agents run in configurable stages — series for dependent work, parallel for independent tasks. Pipelines are reusable templates. The built-in **Spec Kit** preset (`specify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `implement` → `review`) ships as a default, and you can create your own pipelines with any combination of custom agents.

## Features

### AI-Powered Development

- Build apps from conversation — describe what you want, Solune scaffolds the project and creates GitHub Issues
- Customizable Agent Pipelines with series and parallel execution groups
- Live preview with start/stop controls for running applications

### Project Management

- Real-time Kanban board with drag-and-drop columns
- Context switching between applications via `/<app-name>` slash commands
- Full GitHub Projects integration — issues move across columns as agents complete work

### Communication

- Voice input with real-time transcription for chat messages
- Signal messaging — receive pipeline notifications and reply from your phone

### Safety & Guardrails

- Self-editing protection — `@admin`/`@adminlock` guards prevent agents from modifying platform core
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with CSRF protection and encrypted sessions
- Non-root containers, rate limiting, and Content Security Policy headers

## How It Works

Solune orchestrates AI agents through a customizable pipeline. You describe a feature, the platform assigns agents to execution stages, and each agent delivers working code — all tracked on your GitHub Project board.

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
cp solune/.env.example solune/.env
# Edit solune/.env — set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, SESSION_SECRET_KEY
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open **<http://localhost:5173>**.

### GitHub Codespaces

Click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**. The dev container auto-installs everything. Copy `solune/.env.example` to `solune/.env`, add your OAuth credentials, and start the services.

See the [Setup Guide](solune/docs/setup.md) for full instructions including local development without Docker.
