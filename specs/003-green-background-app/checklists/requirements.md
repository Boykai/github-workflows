# Specification Quality Checklist: Green Background for Tech Connect App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] CHK006 Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The green shade choice prioritizes accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) over the originally suggested bright green (#00FF00), which was documented as failing contrast requirements with white text.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed; reasonable defaults were applied based on the detailed issue description and industry standards.
