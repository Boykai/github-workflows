# Implementation Plan: Update App Title to "Happy Place"

**Branch**: `007-app-title-happy-place` | **Date**: 2026-02-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-app-title-happy-place/spec.md`

## Summary

Replace all occurrences of the current application title "Agent Projects" with "Happy Place" across the entire codebase. This is a pure string-replacement branding change affecting 15 files with ~25 occurrences. No logic, data model, or API behavior changes. The approach is a systematic find-and-replace with context-aware casing (preserving surrounding text structure) followed by E2E test updates to match the new title.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12 (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (backend), Vite + React (frontend), Playwright (E2E tests)  
**Storage**: N/A — no storage changes  
**Testing**: Playwright E2E tests (frontend/e2e/), pytest (backend/tests/)  
**Target Platform**: Web application (Linux server + browser)  
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: N/A — no performance impact  
**Constraints**: N/A — string-only change  
**Scale/Scope**: ~25 string occurrences across 15 files

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Specification-First Development — PASS

The feature has a complete `spec.md` with 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P2), Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios for each, clear scope boundaries, edge cases, and 7 functional requirements. All requirements are captured before planning.

### Principle II: Template-Driven Workflow — PASS

All artifacts follow canonical templates from `.specify/templates/`. This plan follows the `plan-template.md` structure. Output artifacts (research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md) follow their respective formats.

### Principle III: Agent-Orchestrated Execution — PASS

This plan was generated by the `speckit.plan` agent as part of the standard specify→plan→tasks→implement pipeline. The agent operates on the well-defined input (`spec.md`) and produces specific outputs.

### Principle IV: Test Optionality — PASS

Tests are not explicitly requested for this feature. However, existing E2E tests assert the application title and MUST be updated to expect "Happy Place" (FR-007). No new tests are needed — only existing test assertions change.

### Principle V: Simplicity and DRY — PASS

This is the simplest possible change: direct string replacement with no new abstractions, patterns, or dependencies. No refactoring, no centralization of the title string (YAGNI — a single constant is unnecessary for a stable branding string).

**Gate Result**: ALL PASS — proceed to Phase 0.

### Post-Phase 1 Re-check — ALL PASS

Design artifacts confirm the change is purely mechanical string replacement. No new entities, APIs, or patterns introduced. All principles remain satisfied.

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 — Web application with `backend/` (Python/FastAPI) and `frontend/` (TypeScript/Vite). This matches the existing repository structure. Changes are string replacements across both layers plus configuration and documentation files.
