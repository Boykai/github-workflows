# Specification Quality Checklist: Pink Background UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items passed validation. The specification:
- Contains 3 prioritized user stories (P1: Launch, P2: Navigation, P3: Accessibility)
- Defines 7 testable functional requirements
- Establishes 5 measurable success criteria
- Identifies 4 edge cases
- Documents 5 assumptions and clear scope boundaries
- Maintains technology-agnostic focus throughout

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).
