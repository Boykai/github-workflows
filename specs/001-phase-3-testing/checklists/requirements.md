# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase 3 — Testing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Coverage tool names (Vitest, pytest-cov, mutmut, Stryker, Hypothesis, fast-check) are referenced as domain terminology to identify existing infrastructure, not as implementation prescriptions.
- Mutation testing threshold of 60% was chosen as a reasonable starting default documented in Assumptions; teams may adjust during planning.
