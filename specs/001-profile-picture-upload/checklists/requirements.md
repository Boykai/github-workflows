# Specification Quality Checklist: Profile Picture Upload

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items have been verified and pass:
- Specification is written in business language without technical implementation details
- All three mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- Functional requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous
- Success criteria include specific measurable metrics (time, percentages, concurrent users)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic and user-focused
- User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- Edge cases are comprehensively identified
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are present
- Scope is clearly bounded to profile picture upload, change, and removal

The specification is ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).
