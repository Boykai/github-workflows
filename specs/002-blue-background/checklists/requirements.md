# Specification Quality Checklist: Blue Background Color

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-14  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All validation criteria have been met. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase.

**Validation Summary**:
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) covering core functionality, accessibility, and dark mode support
- 7 testable functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 5 measurable success criteria, all technology-agnostic
- 4 edge cases identified
- Scope boundaries clearly defined (In Scope / Out of Scope)
- 6 documented assumptions

**Next Steps**: 
- Proceed with `/speckit.clarify` if any questions remain about the requirements
- Or proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. No spec updates required.
