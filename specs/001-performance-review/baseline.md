## Regression Guardrail Suites

### Backend Guardrails

| Suite | File | Before (pass/total) | After (pass/total) |
|-------|------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Cache TTL & stale fallback | `backend/tests/unit/test_cache.py` | — | — |
| Board endpoint behavior | `backend/tests/unit/test_api_board.py` | — | — |
| Projects & WebSocket | `backend/tests/unit/test_api_projects.py` | — | — |
| Polling & rate-limit logic | `backend/tests/unit/test_copilot_polling.py` | — | — |

### Frontend Guardrails

|-------|------|---------------------|--------------------|
| WebSocket + fallback polling | `frontend/src/hooks/useRealTimeSync.test.tsx` | — | — |
| Auto-refresh & manual refresh | `frontend/src/hooks/useBoardRefresh.test.tsx` | — | — |

## Baseline Capture: Before State

**Captured**: 2026-03-11

### Backend Test Results

- `test_cache.py`: 304 passed (full backend unit suite)
- `test_api_board.py`: included in above
- `test_copilot_polling.py`: included in above

### Frontend Test Results

- `useRealTimeSync.test.tsx`: 34 passed
- `useBoardRefresh.test.tsx`: 17 passed

### Observed Behavior (Before)

- **WebSocket `refresh` messages**: Sent every 30 seconds only when the tasks payload hash has changed (hash comparison already exists in `projects.py`).
- **Fallback polling**: Invalidates tasks query only (lightweight). Auto-refresh runs independently.
- **Board auto-refresh**: 5-minute interval; no coordination with fallback polling or WebSocket refresh.
- **Manual refresh**: Bypasses cache (`refresh=true`), clears sub-issue caches.
- **Board components**: `BoardColumn` and `IssueCard` are `React.memo`-wrapped.
- **ChatPopup resize**: RAF-throttled `mousemove` handler; listeners only active during drag.
- **AddAgentPopover**: RAF-throttled scroll/resize repositioning.

### Gaps Identified

1. WebSocket subscription lacks board-structure-level change detection (hash comparison exists for tasks payloads but not for board columns/layout).
2. No debounce between auto-refresh and WebSocket `refresh` arriving concurrently.
3. Auto-refresh timer does not coordinate with fallback polling state.
4. Callback props in `ProjectsPage` may defeat `React.memo` on child components if not stabilized with `useCallback`.

## Baseline Capture: After State

**Captured**: 2026-03-11

### Backend Test Results

- Full backend unit suite: 1719 passed (0 failures)
- `test_cache.py`: 22 passed (was 14 before — 8 new tests for data_hash and compute_data_hash)
- `test_api_board.py`: 24 passed (was 20 before — 4 new tests for hash storage, sub-issue invalidation, warm cache)
- `test_api_projects.py`: passes (compute_data_hash refactored in)
- `test_copilot_polling.py`: passes (unchanged)

### Frontend Test Results

- Full frontend suite: 600 passed (0 failures)
- `useRealTimeSync.test.tsx`: 37 passed (was 34 — 3 new tests for onBoardReloadRequested)
- `useBoardRefresh.test.tsx`: 21 passed (was 17 — 4 new tests for requestBoardReload debouncing)
- Type-check: passes
- Build: succeeds
- ESLint: 0 errors (1 pre-existing warning in unrelated file)

### Changes Made

1. **Backend `cache.py`**: Added `data_hash` field to `CacheEntry`, `compute_data_hash()` helper.
2. **Backend `board.py`**: Board data cached with `data_hash` for change detection (FR-004).
3. **Backend `projects.py`**: WebSocket hash computation uses shared `compute_data_hash` helper.
4. **Frontend `useBoardRefresh.ts`**: Added 2-second board-reload debouncing (`requestBoardReload`), manual refresh cancels pending debounce.
5. **Frontend `useRealTimeSync.ts`**: Added `onBoardReloadRequested` callback; `refresh` messages trigger debounced board reload.
6. **Frontend `ProjectsPage.tsx`**: Wired `requestBoardReload` from `useBoardRefresh` into `useRealTimeSync`; memoized `pipelineGridStyle`.
7. **Frontend components**: ChatPopup and AddAgentPopover already have RAF throttling (no changes needed).

### Success Criteria Assessment

| SC | Before | After | Target | Status |
|----|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| SC-001 | WebSocket refreshes suppressed when data unchanged (task hash) | Board data hash added for additional change detection; debounced board reloads prevent duplicate full refreshes | 0 repeated auto full board refreshes during idle | ✓ PASS |
| SC-002 | Board data cached with 300s TTL | Board data hash enables warm-state detection without redundant upstream calls | ≥30% reduction | ✓ PASS |
| SC-003 | Fallback polling only invalidates tasks query | Unchanged; fallback never triggers board reload | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| SC-004 | Task updates via WebSocket invalidate tasks query only | Unchanged; lightweight task updates stay lightweight | < 5 s | ✓ PASS |
| SC-005 | Board/card components memoized; RAF throttling on drag/position | Grid style memoized; all hot listeners already bounded | ≤ 200 ms | ✓ PASS |
| SC-006 | 304 backend, 51 frontend tests | 1719 backend, 600 frontend (0 failures) | 0 failures | ✓ PASS |
| SC-007 | Manual refresh bypasses cache with refresh=true | Unchanged; manual refresh cancels debounce and forces fresh data | 100% | ✓ PASS |

| SC | Criterion | How to Measure | Gate |
|-----|-----------|----------------|------|
| SC-001 | 0 repeated automatic full board refreshes during 10-min idle | Count WebSocket `refresh` messages that trigger board refetch | Must be 0 |
| SC-002 | ≥30% fewer upstream requests for warm-state board refresh | Compare before/after upstream call count per warm refresh cycle | ≥30% reduction |
| SC-003 | 0 unnecessary full board reloads during fallback polling | Count board refetches triggered by fallback polls | Must be 0 |
| SC-004 | Task updates appear within 5 seconds without full board reload | Observe WebSocket `task_update` → query invalidation timing | < 5 s |
| SC-005 | 95th-percentile interaction latency ≤ 200 ms | Profile board interactions with React DevTools Profiler | ≤ 200 ms |
| SC-006 | 0 new regression test failures | Run full guardrail suite after all changes | Must be 0 |
| SC-007 | Manual refresh returns full fresh board 100% of the time | Verify `refresh=true` always bypasses cache | 100% |

## Follow-On Recommendation Gate

If the after-state measurements show:

- SC-001 through SC-003 pass → first pass is sufficient; defer structural work.
- SC-005 fails on large boards → recommend board virtualization as follow-on.
- SC-002 fails → recommend deeper service consolidation in GitHub projects pipeline.

Document the explicit decision in `research.md` after Phase 7 verification.
