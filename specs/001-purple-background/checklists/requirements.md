**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: February 20, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The purple shade #7C3AED was selected as the "modern violet" option from the issue description, providing a good balance of vibrancy and readability.
- FR-006 uses SHOULD (not MUST) for centralized theme value to keep the spec technology-agnostic while recommending best practice.
- Assumptions section notes that foreground color adjustments may be needed for WCAG AA compliance with the chosen purple shade.
