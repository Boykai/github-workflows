# Specification Quality Checklist: Code Quality Check

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- 30 functional requirements cover all 7 phases from the parent issue.
- 16 measurable success criteria provide verifiable outcomes for each phase.
- 7 user stories are independently testable and prioritized (P1 through P4).
- 6 edge cases address boundary conditions across exception handling, caching, migrations, imports, request cancellation, and strict compiler checks.
- Assumptions section documents 9 reasonable defaults that were applied to avoid unnecessary clarification markers.
