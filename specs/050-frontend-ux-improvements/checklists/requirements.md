## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Six user stories cover all six phases from the parent issue, prioritized by user impact.
- 36 functional requirements cover all phases with testable, unambiguous language.
- 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.
- Edge cases cover error handling, accessibility, and graceful degradation scenarios.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers — all requirements are fully specified using reasonable defaults and assumptions documented in the Assumptions section.
