# Theme Music File Placeholder

This file is a placeholder indicating where the theme music file should be placed.

To enable theme music:
1. Add a file named `theme-music.mp3` in this directory (`/public/`)
2. The file should be in MP3 format
3. Recommended duration: 2-5 minutes (looping is enabled)
4. Recommended volume level: Mixed at moderate volume (will be adjustable by users)

The application will automatically use `/theme-music.mp3` when available.
