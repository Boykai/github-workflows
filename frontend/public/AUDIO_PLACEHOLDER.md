# Audio Placeholder

Since we cannot generate audio files in this environment, please add a theme music file:

1. Name: theme-music.mp3
2. Location: /public/theme-music.mp3
3. Format: MP3
4. Suggested: A pleasant, non-intrusive background music track
5. Duration: 2-5 minutes (will loop automatically)

For testing purposes, you can use:
- Any royalty-free music from sites like freemusicarchive.org
- Creative Commons licensed music
- Your own music compositions

The application will gracefully handle missing audio files by simply not playing music.
