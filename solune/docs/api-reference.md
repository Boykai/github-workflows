# API Reference

This document lists every HTTP, WebSocket, and SSE endpoint exposed by the Solune backend. For interactive browsing and testing, start the backend with `ENABLE_DOCS=true` and visit `/api/docs` for the auto-generated OpenAPI interface.

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`. Unless noted, all endpoints require an active session cookie set by the OAuth flow. The `/health`, `/auth/github`, `/auth/github/callback`, and `/webhooks/github` endpoints are unauthenticated. The `/auth/dev-login` endpoint is also unauthenticated when `DEBUG=true`.

## Health

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

## Authentication

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/auth/github` | Initiate GitHub OAuth flow |
| GET | `/auth/github/callback` | OAuth callback handler |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Get current authenticated user |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Logout and clear session |
| POST | `/auth/dev-login` | Dev-only PAT login (`DEBUG=true` only; JSON body requires a non-empty `github_token` up to 255 chars) |

## Projects

|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/board/projects` | List projects with status field configuration |
| GET | `/board/projects/{project_id}` | Get board data (columns + items) |

## Chat

Chat endpoints power the conversational interface — send messages, receive AI responses, manage proposals, and use the `#agent` command to create custom agents inline.

| DELETE | `/chat/proposals/{id}` | Cancel task proposal |
| POST | `/chat/upload` | Upload a file attachment |

### `#agent` Command

Send `#agent <description> #<status-name>` via chat or Signal to create a custom GitHub agent:

- Fuzzy status column matching (`#in-review`, `#InReview`, `#IN_REVIEW`)
- AI-generated preview with natural language edit loop
- 8-step pipeline: save config → create column → create issue → create branch → commit files → open PR → move to In Review → update pipeline mappings
